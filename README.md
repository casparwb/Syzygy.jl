# Syzygy.jl

In astronomy, a syzygy (/ˈsɪzədʒi/ SIZ-ə-jee; from Ancient Greek συζυγία (suzugía) 'union, yoke') is a roughly straight-line configuration of three or more celestial bodies in a gravitational system.

Syzygy.jl is a Julia code for simulating and visualizing the dynamics of hierarchical multistar systems. This package is being developed by someone with very little experience in software development, and is not meant for use by the general public.
